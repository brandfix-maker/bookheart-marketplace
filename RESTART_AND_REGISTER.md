# ✅ Rate Limit Fixed - Ready to Register!

## What I Did
Increased the rate limit from 3 to 100 attempts per hour (for testing).

## Steps to Register Successfully

### 1. **Restart the API Server**
You need to restart the API server to apply the changes:

**In the terminal window running the API:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
- Then run: `npm run dev`

Or just close that terminal and open a new one:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\brand\Projects\BookHeart\BookHeart Marketplace\apps\api"
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Wait for Server to Start**
You should see:
```
✅ Server successfully started!
🌐 API server running on http://localhost:5000
```

### 3. **Go to Registration Page**
Open: http://localhost:3000/register

### 4. **Use These Credentials**
```
Email:    test@example.com
Username: test
Password: Password123
Confirm:  Password123
✅ Check the terms box
```

### 5. **Click "Create Account"**
It should work now! 🎉

## If It Still Fails

### Option A: Different Email
The email `test@example.com` might already exist from a previous attempt. Try:
- `test2@example.com`
- `mytest@example.com`
- `demo@bookheart.com`

### Option B: Different Username
If username `test` is taken, try:
- `test123`
- `testuser`
- `demo`

### Option C: Clear Rate Limit Cache
The rate limit might be cached in memory. Restarting the API server (Step 1) should clear it.

## After Successful Registration

You'll be automatically:
- ✅ Logged in
- ✅ Redirected to home page
- ✅ Ready to use the app

You can then:
1. Browse the marketplace
2. Create book listings at `/sell`
3. View your profile
4. Start buying/selling books!

## For Future: Restore Rate Limit

After testing, we should restore the rate limit to 3 for security:

Edit `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts`:
```typescript
const registerLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 3, // Back to 3 for production
  message: 'Too many registration attempts, please try again later',
});
```

---

**Status:** ✅ Ready to test  
**Rate Limit:** Increased to 100  
**Next:** Restart API server and try registering!
