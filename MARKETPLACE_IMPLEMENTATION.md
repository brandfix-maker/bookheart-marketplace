## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Queries

**Optimizations:**

- JSONB array queries for trope filtering: `books.tropes ?| ARRAY[...]`
- Efficient pagination with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`
- Left joins for seller information and ratings
- Subqueries for seller average ratings

**Performance:**
- Autocomplete queries: Target <100ms
- Search results: Target <500ms
- Book listing: Target <300ms

### Frontend State Management

**Contexts Used:**
- `AuthContext` - User authentication state
- `WishlistContext` - Wishlist operations
- `CartContext` - Shopping cart operations

**Local State:**
- Filter state with complex nested object
- Pagination state
- Loading states
- View mode preferences

### API Integration

**Environment Variable Required:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Authentication:**
- Bearer token from localStorage for authenticated endpoints
- Optional auth for public endpoints

- **Large Desktop:** > 1280px (5 columns)

### Mobile Optimizations:

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices

1. **Database Performance:**
   - Use JSONB operators for array queries (`?|`, `&&`)
   - Create indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Use subqueries for aggregations (seller ratings)

2. **React Performance:**
   - Debounce user input to reduce API calls
   - Use skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Optimize re-renders with proper state management

3. **UX Design:**
   - Provide immediate visual feedback
   - Show loading states
   - Handle empty states gracefully
   - Offer helpful suggestions when searches fail

4. **Type Safety:**
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
   - Validate API responses
   - Type-safe filter state management

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Search Highlighting:** Text highlighting in BookCard not yet implemented (would require dangerouslySetInnerHTML or a library)
2. **Location Distance Calculation:** Distance calculation from user location not implemented (requires geocoding)
3. **Save Search:** Backend persistence for saved searches not implemented
4. **Infinite Scroll:** Uses pagination instead of infinite scroll for better UX control
5. **Image Optimization:** Cloudinary transformations not configured (using full-size images)

---

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Testing Checklist:
1. Test search with various queries
2. Test all filter combinations
3. Test pagination
4. Test mobile responsiveness
5. Test with/without authentication
6. Test empty states
7. Test error states (network failures)
8. Test wishlist/cart integration

### Monitoring:
- API response times should be < 500ms
- Database query performance
- Image loading times
- User engagement metrics (clicks, searches, filters)
