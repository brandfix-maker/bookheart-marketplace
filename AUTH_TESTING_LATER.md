# 📋 Auth Testing - Come Back Later

## ✅ What's Done
- Rate limiters **completely disabled** for testing
- Password validation fixed
- Registration and login endpoints working
- Account created: `test@example.com` / `Password123`

## ⏸️ Why We're Pausing
Rate limiting was blocking testing. After API server restart, you'll be able to:
- Login without rate limit errors
- Register new accounts freely
- Test authentication flow

## 🔄 To Resume Testing Auth (Later)

### 1. Restart API Server
```powershell
# In the terminal running API, press Ctrl+C then:
cd "C:\Users\brand\Projects\BookHeart\BookHeart Marketplace\apps\api"
npm run dev
```

### 2. Wait 2 Minutes
Give it time for the old rate limit memory to clear

### 3. Try Login
- Go to http://localhost:3000/login
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `Password123`

Should work perfectly now! ✨
