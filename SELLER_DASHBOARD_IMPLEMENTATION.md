# Seller Dashboard MVP - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 What Was Built

A fully functional seller dashboard with core features for managing listings, sales, offers, and messages. This MVP focuses on essential functionality while deferring analytics and Stripe integration for Phase 2.

---

## 📦 Backend Implementation

### 1. **Platform Fee Configuration**
**File:** `packages/shared/src/config/fees.ts`

- Centralized fee configuration (7% platform fee, 2.9% + $0.30 payment processing)
- Helper functions to calculate fees and seller payouts
- No more hardcoded fees throughout the codebase

### 2. **Database Migration**
**File:** `packages/database/migrations/004-notifications.sql`

- New `notifications` table with enums for notification types
- Indexes for efficient querying
- Supports: offer_received, offer_accepted, offer_rejected, offer_countered, message_received, book_sold

**To run the migration:**
```bash
cd packages/database
npm run migrate
```

### 3. **New Services**

  - Create notifications
  - Get notifications (with unread filtering)
  - Mark as read / Mark all as read
  - Get unread count
  - Auto-cleanup old notifications

### 4. **Updated Services**
- **OfferService**: Now creates notifications when offers are received, accepted, rejected, or countered
- **MessageService**: Creates notifications when messages are received

### 5. **New API Routes**
- `GET /api/transactions` - Get seller's transactions
- `GET /api/transactions/:id` - Get single transaction
- `PATCH /api/transactions/:id/tracking` - Update tracking info
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Get unread count
- `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark as read

## ❌ Deferred to Phase 2

As per the MVP requirements, these features were intentionally skipped:

- Analytics tab with charts and insights
- Payments tab with Stripe integration
- CSV exports
- Revenue charts
- Bulk actions
- Advanced filtering
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Automatic notifications via email

**Why:** Need real transaction data and Stripe integration first. These will be added after launch based on seller feedback.

---

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Run the Database Migration
```bash
cd packages/database
npm run migrate
```

### 2. Start the API Server
```bash
cd apps/api
npm run dev
```

### 3. Start the Web Server
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Flow

**Step 1: Create Test Data**
- Register as a seller
- Create a few book listings via `/sell`

**Step 2: Test Listings Tab**
- Navigate to `/dashboard/listings`
- Toggle between grid and table views
- Try actions: Edit, Pause, Mark as Sold, Delete
- Verify empty state appears with no listings

**Step 3: Test Sold Tab**
- Create a manual transaction (or wait for a real sale)
- Navigate to `/dashboard/sold`
- Expand a transaction row
- Upload tracking information
- Verify status timeline updates

**Step 4: Test Offers Tab**
- Have another user create an offer on your book
- Navigate to `/dashboard/offers`
- Test Accept offer (creates notification for buyer)
- Test Counter offer (with validation)
- Test Decline offer

**Step 5: Test Notifications**
- Receive an offer → notification appears
- Click notification → navigates to relevant tab
- Mark as read → badge count updates
- Mark all as read → all notifications marked

**Step 6: Test Mobile**
- Resize browser to mobile
- Verify bottom navigation appears
- Test all tabs work correctly
- Verify tables convert to card views

## 📝 Database Schema Changes

### New Table: `notifications`
```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  type notification_type NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  related_id UUID,
  related_type notification_related_type,
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Indexes:**
- `notifications_user_id_idx`
- `notifications_is_read_idx`
- `notifications_created_at_idx`
- `notifications_user_read_idx`
- `notifications_user_created_idx`

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Platform Fees
Edit `packages/shared/src/config/fees.ts` to change:
- Platform fee percentage (default: 7%)
- Payment processing fee (default: 2.9% + $0.30)

### Notification Polling
Edit `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/notifications-bell.tsx`:
- Line 20: Change `30000` to adjust polling interval (in milliseconds)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Future Improvements

1. **Wishlists & Offer Counts**: Currently showing "0" on listing cards. Need to implement wishlist and offer count queries.

2. **Transaction Creation**: Transactions are currently created manually. Need to integrate with Stripe checkout flow.

3. **Email Notifications**: Not implemented. Users only see in-app notifications.

4. **Image Optimization**: Book cover images could benefit from Next.js Image optimization.

5. **Pagination**: Listings and transactions use client-side rendering. Consider server-side pagination for large datasets.
