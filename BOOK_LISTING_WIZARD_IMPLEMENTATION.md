    M -->|Publish| O[POST /api/books]
    N --> P[Draft Saved]
    O --> Q[Show Success + Confetti]
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Image Upload**: Currently stores preview URLs, needs Cloudinary integration
2. **Price Suggestions**: Uses mock calculation, needs real market data
3. **Draft Auto-save**: Basic implementation, could add conflict resolution
4. **Offline Support**: Not yet implemented
5. **Barcode Scanning**: Placeholder for future implementation

## 🧪 Testing Checklist
